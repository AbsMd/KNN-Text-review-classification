## A KNN model for classifying text reviews into binary 1 and -1 scores to indicate positive and negative sentiments with NLP text preprocessing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and k-fold cross validation.

1. Preprocessing:
  - Removing
    - HTML tags
    - URLs
    - Email-ids
    - Numbers
    - Punctuation
    - Accented text
  - Tokenizing
  - Removing stop words
  - Lemmatizing

2. Feature extraction - Countvectorizer
3. Similarity/Distance metric used for knn - Cosine similarity
4. Cross-validation - k-fold
